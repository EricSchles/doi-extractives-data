Subject: Authority to operate for EITI Next, currently staged at https://federalist.18f.gov/preview/18F/doi-extractives-data/dev/

A scoped security assessment of this system has been performed by the 18F DevOps team in accordance with 18F methodologies to detect vulnerabilities in sites managed by second or third parties.

The EITI Open Data Portal is a public data portal that tells the story of natural resource revenues from Federal lands. It supports the U.S. implementation of the international Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, is part of the cross-government Project Open Data and supports the goals of the U.S. National Action Plan for Open Government Partnership.

The U.S. earns revenue on natural resources extracted from its Federal lands, both onshore and offshore. This is a major source of revenue for both the country and local municipalities, and includes revenue from resources such as oil, gas, coal and geothermals.

This repository contains the new code for useiti.doi.gov, which is a website that includes both curated content and raw data that will inform the national and international conversation around extractive industries revenue. It will provide a valuable resource for data and information analysis and visualizations that can be readily understood and accessed by the public for re-use through other media and applications.

Using NIST FIPS 199 methodology, this system has been given the following security categories if the following are lost:

Confidentiality: n/a
Integrity: Low
Availability: Low

The system contains only publicly available information for general consumption and overall meets the requirements in Guidelines for Granting Authority to Operate 18F Hosted Open Data Systems.

Based on the results from automated scans of the infrastructure, operating system, code base, and attack surface area, I have determined that the risk to agency operations, data, or assets resulting from the operation of the system is acceptable.

Accordingly, I am issuing an authorization to operate the system in its existing environment through November 30th, 2016 under the following conditions:

The security boundary of the underlying infrastructure or the system will not be significantly altered; changes will require re-assessment.
The security authorization of the information system will remain in effect through the date above, as long as the system falls under the definition of an OpenData system and any critical security issues identified as a result of continuous monitoring are remediated immediately.
